      I can work where I want, for how much I want, and what times I want! Being time-rich allows me to think in a more self-directed way, be creative, and solve bigger, better and more relevant issues. In turn, this leads to more self-fulfillment. The office environment is kick-ass and creates super synergies which accelerates learning!

      Enspiral is the first job I've had were everyone is pushing on the edges of the box, everyone is seeking change and everyone cares. In my previous jobs I'd always feel alone in my quest to do good, but at Enspiral there are a whole bunch of like-minded people working together.
