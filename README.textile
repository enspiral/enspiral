p. The code for the Enspiral Website.


h2. Starting App

p. Normal Rails way. Create database and run rails server. 


h2. Branches

p. The branching system we are using for the Enspiral Website is:

* Use feature and bug branches that are branched off of the master branch.
* If long development and other developers rebase from master as needed.
* Rested staging branch as needed from master.
* Merge feature and bug branches into staging for testing.
* When features and bug fixes have been tested and accepted merge the respective branches into master.
* Master branch is to be considered 'production ready' code. Everything should have been tested.
* When ready for production deploy merge master into production and deploy.
* Any emergency hotfixes on production branch should be merged back into master.


h2. Servers

p. Both production and staging are on the ruby server.
